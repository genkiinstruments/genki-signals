# Genki Signals

Genki signals is a library to do real time signal processing and machine learning on sensor data. Using this library you
can connect devices and stream data from them, and create processing pipelines to process the data. You can also
visualize all of this in real time, and record data and serialize the pipelines to disk.

## Installation
Genki Signals is available on PyPi and can be installed using pip:
```bash
pip install genki-signals
```

## Usage
Genki Signals is designed to work in Jupyter notebooks. You can find some examples in the [examples](examples) folder.
