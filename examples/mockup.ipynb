    "This library consists of four entities:\n",
    "* `SignalSource`: A class which defines how raw data is read. Referred to as a \"signal\".\n",
    "    * This data can have any dimensionality but the last axis must be the time axis.\n",
    "    * e.g. the MouseDataSource is a 2d signal with dimensions (2, T). It captures the x and y positions of your mouse on the computer screen.\n",
    "* `SignalFunction`: A class which defines operations on real-time data (i.e. signals) which produces new signals, sometimes referred to as \"derived signals\". \n",
    "    * e.g. the Add operation can add together two signals assuming that their dimensionality matches.\n",
    "* `SignalManager`: A class which encapsulates `SignalSources` and `SignalFunctions` units, allowing you to skip most of the boilerplate and record data.\n",
    "* `SignalInspector`: An abstract class which receives data from the `SignalManager` via callback. It has two modes, <i>live</i> and <i>static</i>.\n",
    "    * The <i>static</i> mode, i.e. viewing data you have already recorded, has the following:\n",
    "        * The `Analyzer` class is for visualzing information on entire time series.\n",
    "        * The `Labeller` class has ux so that the user can label their data, written as an annotation file.\n",
    "    * The <i>live</i> mode, e.g. viewing model inference in real time, has the following:\n",
    "        * The `Visualizer` can display real-time data with many different types of plots, e.g. spectrogram, trace, line and barplots.\n"
