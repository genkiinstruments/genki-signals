    "This distinction is somewhat arbitrary - we could, theoretically, sample a single value from the microphone and then wrap it in a Sampler. But A) such a single sample is extremely unlikely to be useful and B) the `Sampler` will not be able to reach such a high sample rate because of how it is implemented (samples a single data point at a time and then tries to sleep for the right amount of time). The `MicSignalSource` has `chunk_size` with a default value of 1024 that delegates the complex sampling process to lower level software and only receives data chunks of that size.\n",

    "On the other hand, we could also have called the camera a `Sampler` - to record video there is a limit to how many frames per second we can reasonably record. But for a camera it might be quite useful to grab a single frame on some other (slower) schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "The distinction between `SignalSource` and `Sampler` is mostly useful to combine separate sources into one. Suppose we have some external device that we are streaming data from - e.g. a chip with an IMU sensor, and we want to create a labelled dataset of some movements for machine learning. We can use the keyboard to label the data: we press some key when we do the movement. So we want to combine some bluetooth signal source with the keyboard one, and we need to synchronise their timestamps somehow. Clocks in a distributed system are notoriously hard to deal with so in a situation like this it is best to mark one device as the master clock. We make the bluetooth source the sampler and each time we receive a data point we query the keyboard source for a value.\n",

    "\n",
    "At this point it is worth introducing one of the key data structures underlying Genki Signals, the `DataBuffer`. The `DataBuffer` is similar to a pandas `DataFrame`, it acts as a mapping from names to sequences. There are two major differences between a `DataBuffer` and a `DataFrame`: \n",
    "* `DataBuffer`s are implemented in numpy and thus more performant than `DataFrames`\n",
    "* Series in `DataBuffer`s can be n-dimensional in general. \n",
    "\n",
    "Having signals be n-dimensional can be very useful. For example, if we have a 3D signal from a gyroscope we can stream it into a buffer and use the name `'gyro'` - using a `DataFrame` we would have to separate into e.g. `'gyro_x'`, `'gyro_y'`, and `'gyro_z'`. An even better example is the camera: a video signal might have the shape `(height, width, n_channels, t)` which we can store under a single name in a `DataBuffer`. Each entry in a `DataBuffer` is just a numpy `ndarray`, and they are synced over the last dimension which is assumed to be time.\n",
